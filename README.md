This project is a Smart Irrigation System developed as part of the AICTEâ€“Edunetâ€“Shell Internship program. It uses a trained machine learning model to predict the ON/OFF status of 20 sprinklers based on real-time sensor values, aiming to optimize water usage in agriculture.


ðŸ§¾ Files & Their Purpose

1.irrigation_dataset.csv
A structured dataset (provided by mentor) containing sensor readings and corresponding sprinkler statuses. Used as the base for model training.

2.model_training.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook used to:

Load and explore the CSV dataset

Preprocess and scale the sensor input values

Train a classification model (e.g., RandomForest or similar)

Export the final model as model.pkl using joblib


3.model.pkl
The trained machine learning model saved from the notebook, ready to be loaded in the app.

4.app.py
The main Streamlit app file that:

Loads the .pkl model

Takes 20 sensor values as slider inputs (scaled between 0 and 1)

Predicts sprinkler ON/OFF status in real-time

Displays results dynamically in the browser
